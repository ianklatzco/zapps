Zapps -- Zero-Dependency Applications
=====================================

Zapps are an application packaging format for Linux.

For users, they provide simplicity and freedom: a Zapp can be installed in any location, on any linux distribution, and will "just work".
Zapps can run fine directly from a jumpdrive, or, even varying versions of the same application can be easily used on the same computer with no fuss.

For developers and packagers, Zapps also provide simplicity: do the work to package something as a Zapp just one time,
and now you have a package anyone can use, anywhere.
No distro-specific worries; and users can always get the latest version of the application, direct from you.

Less is more.  Zapps are as simple as we can make them.

> Does the Zapp format have tradeoffs or drawbacks?

Everything has tradeoffs.

_However_.

We consider most of them to be either "worth it", or "mitigated".

See more in the [deeper docs about tradeoffs](./src/compare.md#tradeoffs).

We also [compare](./src/compare.md#how-is-this-different-from) Zapps to several alternative approaches in that doc!

---------



Variants
--------

The core Zapp standard is meant to be utterly simple, foolproof, and portable.

However, there are a few variations!  These generally trade some complexity in order to satisfy some other goals, or make more efficient or more compact packages.

Check out the [Variant docs](./src/varations.md)!

Zapps grew out of the work on [Warpforge](http://warpforge.io/)!
We develop the spec alongside the Warpforge and Warpsys projects.

We'd love to have you join our [community](https://warpforge.notion.site/Community-676332742afa4276be571f7d035d55db)!

- If you're interested in adopting Zapps as someone who ships software -- join us!
- If you're using Zapps and need support -- we're happy to hear from you!  (We certainly hope it Just Works, though ;))
